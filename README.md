## Description

W3Pin is a Web3 post card service that aggregates an identity's on-chain activities over the year and use those data to build a profile in the form of a post card, which allows customization, collection and social interactions.

As the year is coming to an end, through this service, we hope to encourage Web3 social engagement by providing a convenient way of showcasing, customizing, interacting and sharing users' wrapped annual activities.

## Features

- Download a print of the post card in view as a .png
- View or receive achievements based on the count of one's activities
- Edit & customize a post card's achievements in display
- Edit & customize a post card's banner through file upload or DALL-E text-2-image generation
- Write a description or note on the post card
- When viewing one's own post card, one can customize and collect the card for oneself
